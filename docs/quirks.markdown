# Quirks

> A Quirk (個こ性せい, lit. "Individuality"), formerly known as a Meta Ability (異い能のう, lit. "Extraordinary Ability"), is a superhuman ability that a person can possess.

**Quirks** are superhuman powers. In this mod, they come in the form of a set of abilities which can be activated with the **Ability Keys** (**Z**, **X**, **C** and **V** by default). Your **Quirk** is displayed on your **Player Card**, which can be viewed with the **M** key. **Quirks** start off with only 1 ability, but gain more as you [level up](/wiki/quirk-levels).

There are currently 14 different **Quirks** in **QU**:
* [Air Cannon](./air-cannon)
* [Air Walk](./air-walk)
* [Black Whip](./black-whip)
* [Crystal](./crystal)
* [Explosion](./explosion)
* [Hardening](./hardening)
* [Hellflame](./hellflame)
* [Invisibility](./invisibility)
* [Lightspeed](./lightspeed)
* [Navel Laser](./navel-laser)
* [Resizer](./resizer)
