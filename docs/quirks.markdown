> A Quirk (個こ性せい, lit. "Individuality"), formerly known as a Meta Ability (異い能のう, lit. "Extraordinary Ability"), is a superhuman ability that a person can possess.

**Quirks** are superhuman powers. In this mod, they come in the form of a set of abilities which can be activated with the **Ability Keys** (**Z**, **X**, **C** and **V** by default). Your **Quirk** is displayed on your **Player Card**, which can be viewed with the **M** key. **Quirks** start off with only 1 ability, but gain more as you [level up](./Quirk-Levels).

There are currently 14 different **Quirks** in **QU**:
* [Air Cannon](./Air-Cannon)
* [Air Walk](./Air-Walk)
* [Black Whip](./Black-Whip)
* [Crystal](./Crystal)
* [Explosion](./Explosion)
