> Danger Sense allows the user to detect any potential threats in the surrounding area, thus giving the user the opportunity to properly react to them quickly, similar to a sixth sense.

**Danger Sense** is one of the [Quirks](/wiki/quirks) available to the player in **QU**. **Danger Sense** is a unique [Quirk](/wiki/quirks), as it has no abilities.

Instead, **Danger Sense** will display nearby hostile mobs in the corner of your screen, alerting you of the threat.
