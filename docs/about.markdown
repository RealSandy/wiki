Welcome to the official wiki for [Quirks Unchained](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quirksunchained), written and maintained by [RealSandy](https://github.com/realsandy).

[Quirks Unchained](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quirksunchained) is a Forge mod for Minecraft Java, created by [Stagman](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/Stagman/projects), with models by [Callout](https://curseforge.com/members/callout662/projects).

We have an active Discord community, which you can join via [this link](https://discord.gg/5Kjepm9uTn). We have a lot of both general and mod-focused chat in this server, and you can make suggestions of custom Quirks and/or support items in a dedicated channel. We also have space to file bug reports, and there are sneak peeks posted before each update releases.
