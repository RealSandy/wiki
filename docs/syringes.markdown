# Syringes

**Syringes** are items that change what [Quirk](/wiki/quirks) you have. They are currently unobtainable in **Survival**, and can only be obtained through the **Creative Menu** and the **give** command. There are 15 different types of **Syringe**, one for each [Quirk](/wiki/quirks), and an extra **Random Syringe**.

## Use
**Right-Click**ing with any **Syringe** in your hand will replace your current [Quirk](/wiki/quirks) with the one corresponding to that **Syringe**.

## Random Syringe
The **Random Syringe** will, when used, replace your current [Quirk](/wiki/quirks) with any random [Quirk](/wiki/quirks).

## Trivia
In earlier versions, there was a bug where certain [Quirks](/wiki/quirks) could not be obtained with a **Random Syringe**.
