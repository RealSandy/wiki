# Quirk Levels

In **QU**, there is a [Quirk](/wiki/quirks) levelling system. Pressing **M** will bring up your **Player Card**, which includes information on your current [Quirk](/wiki/quirks), your **Quirk Level**, how much **Quirk XP** you have, and your **Skill Points**.

## Quirk Levels
In **QU**, you start at **Quirk Level** 0, with access to only your **Z** ability. By killing mobs, you can level up all the way to **Quirk Level** 60, earning a **Skill Point** each time you level up, and possibly unlocking a new ability at **Quirk Level** 10, 20 and 30, if your [Quirk](/wiki/quirks) has those abilities.

## Quirk XP
Every mob you kill gives you 1 **Quirk XP**. Every 25 **XP**, you level up, gaining 1 **Skill Point** and possibly unlocking a new ability.

## Skill Points
Every time you level up, you get a **Skill Point**. You can use this to either upgrade your **Strength** or **Health** stat, on your **Player Card**.

Each point in **Strength** increases the damage your [Quirk](/wiki/quirks) abilities do, but __not__ your vanilla damage.

Each point in **Health** adds half a heart to your maximum health.
